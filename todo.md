You are a very highly experienced and senior level software coder and engineer also you have immense product owner knowledge and end to end UI and UX very highly experienced UI Design expert So make the software patches very very accurate and highly working code only and think thoroughly and implement very very carefully and fully integrated UI and beautiful user experience and well deeply though and crafted UI changes/updates

Do these patches one by one so we test and complete and save all changes robustly
[done] there should be option to see which headers we are removing from UI view so that we have a seperated list of removed headers so that we can restore them anypoint in time and show them in UI again
[] Show the licensing information in our main app UI where we have the main title besides it in smaller yellow text we have to show that license valid up to by picking up from thelicense.Txtfile and showing it in human readable format

[] When multiple scan items are selected in the settings configuration we shall highlight an input data screened on our main application screen as yellow input fields highlighted and we shall scan them one by one and they turn green one by one and then when all required scan fields are passed then we shall reume the older workflow of showing final PASS or FAIL So best basically when the user is scanning he can scan one by one so the yellow highlighted fields to be scanned get highlighted into Orange highlights once the previous scanned value passes and then we can iterate dynamically through all the mandatory scan fields and when all the mandatories can fields pause one by one serially then the final pass result will show pass Otherwise if any of the mandatory scanned fields fail it shall resume our failed scenario as implemented right now where we ask the user for failed PIN verification to proceed and also the failed scan input field should also be turned highlighted red
